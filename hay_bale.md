# Hay Bale  

The **Hay Bale** is an obstacle introduced in the [v0.20.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.20.0) “Open Season” update on October 27, 2024.  

## Location & Spawning  
Hay Bales are exclusive to Harvest Mode and only spawn in [Hay Sheds](buildings/hay_sheds) and the [Barn](/buildings/barn).  

## Loot & Mechanics  
- The Hay Bale does not drop loot when broken.  

## Tips  
- The Hay Bale has 180 health and is large, making it a strong source of cover.  
- Hay Sheds are scattered throughout the map, each containing a Hay Bale. Use them to your advantage in combat.  
- Be cautious, as Hay Sheds may also contain [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel) or [Super Barrels](/obstacles/super_barrel), which can explode when hit, destroying your cover or harming you.  
- The Hay Bale does not shrink much when damaged, but its sudden destruction can be surprising.
