# Large Bridge
The **Large Bridge** is a massive structure added in the [v0.18.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.18.0) “Back in the Saddle” update on June 8, 2024. 
# Location & Spawning
A few Large Bridges spawn every map crossing rivers (many more [Small Bridges](/buildings/small_bridge) spawn). The low spawn rate of bridges is balanced by the high quality of loot found there.
# Loot & More
Large Bridges have a lot of loot, most importantly an [AEGIS Crate](/obstacles/aegis_crate) and a few[ Gun Cases](/obstacles/gun_case). Lower-value crates also make up part of the Large Bridge. It also has a massive [Tank](/obstacles/tank) that makes great cover, as well as [Tear Gas Crates](/obstacles/tear_gas) that aid in killing and hurting players.
# Tips
- Grab some [Throwables](/weapons/throwables) from the [Grenade Crates](/obstacles/grenade_crate) near the edges of the bridge, and use the grenade-hopping trick to blast grenades all over the bridge, insta-killing many potentially armed players. 
- Be careful when looting the high-value crates on the bridge, as [Barrels](/obstacles/barrel) linger there.
- Counter this by damaging - but not destroying - the barrel. When a player nears one, shoot it down. 
- Use the [Tank](/obstacles/tank) and [Sandbags](/obstacles/sandbags) as indestructible cover. 
- Bullets cannot pass through the Large Bridge, so consider yourself safe there. 

# Trivia
- There have been many bugs with the Large Bridge where it spawned to nowhere or didn’t fully cross a river.
