# Small Bridge
The **Small Bridge** is a small building added in the [v0.16.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.16.0) “A Sailor’s Dream” update on February 25, 2024. 

# Location & Spawning
Many Small Bridges can spawn scattered around the map crossing rivers. Often, you see these connecting pieces of land, though there have been instances where bridges to overlap or lead to the ocean. 

# Loot & More
All Small Bridges contain some sort of loot at their center - it’s ideal to cross these bridges as certain ones may harbor very good loot. Note that if loot is in the river, it will stop at the small bridge, pooling up at its side.

# Tips
- Bullets are **not** blocked by the small bridge, so be careful when fighting. 
- Loot may end up near a river, which may carry it to a Small Bridge - it will pile up there. 
  - This trick works best near fights, as dead players' loot may have fallen there. 
- Try to cross these bridges when possible, as they may give you some loot. 

# Trivia
- There have been a few events where the Small Bridges lead to the ocean, overlap, or don’t fully cross a river. This is caused by miniscule patches of land touching the bridge - the game thinks it is a large piece of land, and spawns the bridge there.
