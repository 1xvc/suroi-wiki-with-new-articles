# Piano
The **Piano** is an indestructible object added in the [v0.19.0](https://github.com/HasangerGames/suroi/releases/tag/v0.19.0) “High-Caliber Negotiations” update on September 22, 2024. It is an obstacle designed for adding fun and interactivity with the [Headquarters](/buildings/headquarters). 

# Location & Spawning
Currently, only 1 Piano spawns per map in the [Headquarters 2nd Floor](buildings/headquarters_second_floor] next to the [HQ Vault](/buildings/headquarters_vault). 

# Loot & More
Since the Piano is indestructible, it drops no loot However, it can be interacted with - if a player hits the Piano with their [Fists](/weapons/melees/fists), the Piano will play odd-sounding chords. 

# Tips
Don’t attempt to use the Piano as cover - its positioning doesn’t allow you to manipulate its indestructibleness. 
If another suroian is playing the Piano, join in with them - but surprise them by using a CQC weapon to quickly obliterate them.
The Piano also can be played in addition with the [Speaker](/obstacles/speaker) to add to the ‘atmosphere’ of the HQ.

# Trivia
Surviv also had a piano - albeit a different form - and similarities were incorporated here.
