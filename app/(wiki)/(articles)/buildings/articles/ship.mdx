The **Cargo Ship** is a sub-building of the [Port](/buildings/port). It was added in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It features a cargo area, control room, and a secret vault, and is the home of the [Tango 51](/weapons/guns/tango_51).

# Location & Spawning
The Cargo Ship can be found always spawning offshore of the Port on the edge of the map.

# Areas
## Cargo Area
The cargo area of the ship, located in the center, contains many containers. You can use these for cover and to get some quick loot.

## Control Room
Located towards the stern of the ship, control room doesn't contain much loot, and it has some explosive panels near the windows. However, it does contain the very important [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can).

## Vault
The vault, located in the bow of the ship, is the most valuable area of the ship. It contains a secret room with a chance of a Tango 51 inside. To get in, however, you need to solve the puzzle.

<details><summary>**Show Puzzle Solution**</summary>In order to solve the puzzle, grab the [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can) from the Control Room. Then, walk to the front of the ship and go to the generator. Use the Gas Can to activate the generator and the door to the Vault will open.</details>

# Tips
- You can walk on the sides of the ship (you don't need to go through Control Room to get to the back).
- Get a decent gun as soon as you can before entering the ship, so you can defend yourself.
  - If you're the first one there, you may be able to unlock the Vault before anyone gets there.

# Trivia
- Despite clearly having stairs into the control room, the stairs don't actually lead to another layer
