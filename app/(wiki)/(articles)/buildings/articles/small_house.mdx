The **Small House** is a building added in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It is small and compact structure with decent loot density, perfect for getting geared up early game. The small house replaced the bigger House that was added in v0.9.0.

# Location & Spawning
The Small House is a very common building around the map and can spawn anywhere on land.

# Areas
## Bathroom
The Bathroom contains a single toilet. 
    - If the toilet has a poo in it, it likely contains guns or other weapons.
    - If the toilet doesn't have a poo in it, it likely contains healing items such as [Gauze](/healing/gauze) or [Cola](/healing/cola)

## Bedroom 
The bedroom contains a bed, a bookshelf, and a small chest.

## Foyer
The foyer contains a red couch, a large chest, and a bookshelf.

## Kitchen & Dining Area
The Kitchen contains a stove and a fridge. 
    - Many players don't realize that the fridge drops 2-3 Colas when broken. Even late game, you can often check Small Houses and still find some unbroken ones.

The Dining Area has a table with two chairs and a small chest by the door.
    - Players can hide under the table.

# Tips
- While the Colas from the fridge are valuable, try and find a weapon to defend yourself with first in case another player enters the Small House.
- If you have a gun with good obstacle DPS like an assault rifle or DMR, you can blow up the stove from outside through the window.
    - This will kill or severly damage opponents. 
- Use doors to block damage and frustrate your enemies.
    - The door in the Bedroom is particularly effective at this and useful if you have no weapons.
