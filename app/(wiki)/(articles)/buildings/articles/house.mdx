<Removed/>

The **House** is a building added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It was later removed in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023. It has a decent amount of loot for early game.

# Areas
## Foyer
The Foyer contains no loot, but it does have a [Table](/obstacles/table) and two [Chairs](/obstacles/chair).
    - However, the ability to hide under tables was not added until v0.11.0, so players were never able to hide under the tables in the House

## Kitchen
The Kitchen, directly next to the entrance, contains a [Stove](/obstacles/stove) and a [Fridge](/obstacles/fridge).
    - Many players don't realize that the fridge drops [2-3 Colas](/loot#fridge) when broken. Even late game, you can often check Houses and still find some unbroken ones.

## Bedroom
The Bedroom, located in the corner direclty opposite the entrance, contains a [Bed](/obstacles/bed), and a [Bookshelf](/obstacles/bookshelf).

## Living Room
The Living Room, across from the Bathroom contains a [Couch](/obstacles/couch), [TV](/obstacles/tv), and [Large Drawer](/obstacles/large_drawer).

## Bathroom
The Bathroom contains a singular [Toilet](/obstacles/toilet).

## Garage
The Garage contains a Bookshelf, [Regular Crate](/obstacles/regular_crate), [Barrel](/obstacles/barrel) and a [Washing Machine](/obstacles/washing_machine).
    - The door to the Garage can be punched until broken.
    - The washing machine has a 1/3 chance to drop the "no kil pls" skin and a 2/3 chance to drop the "Verified" skin (see [loot table](/loot#washing_machine)).

# Tips
- Be careful of the long corridor, as it's easy to get caught and sprayed down.
- You can easily kill inexperienced opponents if they're low by backing up and shooting through the door with an assault rifle, which they won't expect.

# Trivia
- The House was designed by platonthek
- The Garage has an oil stain on the floor, possibly suggesting a car or other vehicle had been there before
= The code for the House still exists so it's possible to make it to spawn on a self-hosted server
