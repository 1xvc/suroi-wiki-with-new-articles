Trees are a type of obstacle that spawn on the map commonly. They were added into suroi in v0.1.0 on May 20, 2023. They come in 3 variants.

# Background
Trees are a type of perennial plant with leaves, thick stems known as "trunks", and roots that can reach over 20 feet deep. There are around 73000 species of trees, which are classified into either deciduous or evergreen trees. Most trees are 5 to 40 meters in height, but some species can grow up to over 70 meters tall. The tallest tree in the world, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) in California, reaches 116 meters in height.

# Strategies
- Trees make decent cover from enemies.
    - Pine trees have a larger hitbox, making it harder for your opponent to shoot you from beind your cover. 
    - Birch trees have higher health, allowing you to buy more time or force your opponent to waste additional ammo. 
    - However, all 3 variants can be easily destroyed with any high-dps weapon in a matter of seconds.

# Location
Trees are extremely common obstacles and can spawn just about anywhere on the map. Birch and pine trees are rarer than oak trees, making them harder to find.
