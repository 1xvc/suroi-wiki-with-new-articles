Trees are a type of obstacle that spawn on the map commonly. They were added to the game in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023, and come in 3 variants.

# Strategies
## Using
- Trees make decent cover from enemies.
    - Pine trees have a larger hitbox, making it harder for your opponent to shoot you from beind your cover. 
    - Birch trees have higher health, allowing you to buy more time or force your opponent to waste additional ammo. 
    - However, all 3 variants can be easily destroyed with any high-dps weapon in a matter of seconds.

## Countering
- If your opponent is hiding behind a tree to avoid shots or heal up, just shoot the tree down. They have low health and are easy to destroy.
- In the end game, campers may hide in the overlapping area of 2 trees. Shoot a bullet or two into these areas to chase any remaining players out.

# Location
Trees are extremely common obstacles and can spawn just about anywhere on the map. Birch and pine trees are rarer than oak trees, making them harder to find.
