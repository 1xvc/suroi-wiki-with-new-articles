Crates are a type of obstacle that spawn around the map. They come in four distinct variants with different loot. Regular crates were
first added to the game in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. Later, update v0.5.0 "Locked & Loaded" brought the
other crate variants.

# Location and Spawning

Crates are generally very common and spawn frequently out in the open. Crates and their variants can also be found inside some buildings.
The Regular Crate is the most common, with the AEGIS and Flint crates being rarer. The Melee Crate is the rarest as only one spawn per game.

# Loot & More

All crates drop some sort of loot. The Regular Crate drops the worst loot, while the AEGIS and Flint crates drop better loot. The Melee Crate
is special as it only drops melee weapons.

# Tips

- Crates are very common, so you can usually find one if you need loot.
- Try to go for the AEGIS and Flint crates first as they drop better loot.
- Crates can provide limited cover in a pinch, however they are easily destroyed.

# Trivia
