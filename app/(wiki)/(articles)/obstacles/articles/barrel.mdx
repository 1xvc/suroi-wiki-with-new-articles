The **Barrel** is an explosive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the v0.1.0 "We're back, baby" update on May 20th, 2023. The [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel) is a variation of the normal Barrel.

# Location & Spawning
Barrels can be found spawned randomly around the map, and can also be found in [Buildings](/buildings) such as the [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse) and the [Port](/buildings/port). Only **80** spawn per map.

# Loot & More
The Barrel drops no loot upon being broken, but does create an explosion that damages players and other [Obstacles](/obstacles).

# Tips
- If a Barrel has low health and an enemy is nearby, try shooting the barrel to make it explode and eliminate the enemy.
- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, try hiding behind a barrel, but don't get too close, or it might explode on you!
- If there's smoke coming out of the barrel, that means the barrel is low on health, and you should avoid getting too close.
