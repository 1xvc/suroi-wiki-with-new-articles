The [Super Barrel](/obstacles/super_barrel) and the [Large Refinery Barrel](/obstacles/Large_Refinery_Barrel) 
  are variations of the normal Barrel.
# Location & Spawning
Barrels can be found spawned randomly around the map, it can also be found in building such as the [Warehouse](/buildings/warehouse) and the [Port](/buildings/port). Only **80** spawn per map.
# Loot & More
The Barrel drops **no loot** upon being broken.

# Tips
- If a Barrel has low health and an enemy is nearby, try shooting the barrel to make it explode and eliminate the enemy.
- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, try hiding behind a barrel, but don't get too close, or it might explode on you!
- If there's smoke coming out of the barrel, that means the barrel is low on health, and you should avoid getting too close.
