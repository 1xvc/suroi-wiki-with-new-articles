The **Fridge** is an [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It drops [Colas](/healing/colas).

# Location & Spawning
Fridges spawn in the Kitchens of both [Houses](/buildings/house) and [Small Houses](/buildings/small_house).

# Loot & More
The Fridge reflects bullets, and always drops 2-3 Colas upon being broken.

# Tips
- Many players don't know that you can break Fridges, so you can often find them late-game in Houses/Small Houses that are otherwise completely looted.
- Be careful if using a shotgun to destroy the Fridge, as you could damage yourself with the reflected bullets.
