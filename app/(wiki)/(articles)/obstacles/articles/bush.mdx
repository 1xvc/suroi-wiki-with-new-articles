The **Bush** is an obstacle that spawns frequently around the map. It is mostly opaque and can be moved through. The **Blueberry Bush** is a larger and opaque varation of the standard Bush, and contains loot underneath.

# Strategies
## Using
- If you're low on health and have nowhere else to go, you can try hiding in a bush to heal.
- You can hide in a bush with a shotgun or SMG and ambush other players as they pass.
- Remember that you aren't totally invisible inside a regular Bush, unless you have a Ghillie suit.
  - However, since Blueberry Bushes are opaque this doesn't apply

## Countering
- If you look very closely, you can still see players in normal Bushes.
- Look out for telltale healing particles in a bush, because it means another player is hiding.
  - Usually players who are healing in a bush are low on health, so this can be an easy kill.
  - Some newer players may not fully hide themselves in bushes, and become easy targets.
- If you aren't sure where players are during the final stages of the zone, they could be hiding in bushes. Shoot at a couple and see if a player comes out.
- Always try and pick up the loot in Blueberry Bushes, as they can have rare loot occasionally and are a good source of Consumables.

# Location
