The Автомат Калашникова образца 1947 года (Kalashnikov's Automatic Rifle Model 1947), known in-game is the AK-47, is an assault rifle utilizing 7.62mm ammunition.

# Background
The AK-47 was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov between 1945 and 1947. Accepted into service in 1949, its reliability and cost have made it and its variants a popular choice in miliataries around the world. It was superseded by AKM and later the 5.45mm AK-74.

# Strategies
## Using 
- The AK-47 has superior accuracy to other comparable weapons such as the <Link href="/weapons/guns/arx160">ARX-160</Link>, <Link href="/weapons/guns/aug">AUG</Link>, and <Link href="/weapons/guns/micro_uzi">Micro Uzi</Link>. Take advantage of this when using against opponents with inaccurate weapons.
  - Consequentially, it is advantageous to have a 4x or 8x scope when using the AK-47.
- At short-range, the AK-47 will also beat other fairly accurate weapons such as the <Link href="/weapons/guns/mp40">MP40</Link>, because it has higher DPS. Move closer to use this to a greater effect.
- The AK-47 has a standing spread of only 2 degrees. If you have an 8x or 15x scope, you can stand still to "snipe" players at long range.
  - Don't stand still for too long, or in the same spot. This makes you easier for an opponent to hit or figure out where you are.
- If you have a shotgun or a sniper, you can use the AK-47 to finish off an opponent after weakening them.
- The AK-47 is neither an excellent weapon nor a bad one. It is reliable but may struggle against stronger armor later in game. Some other common guns such as the <Link href="/weapons/guns/aug">AUG</Link> may fit your playstyle better, and rarer weapons are usually directly superior.

## Countering
- If you have a good high-DPS CQC weapon such as a shotgun or SMG, a good tactic against an AK-47 user is to get as close as possible to try and negate any advantages they may have with accuracy. 
  - Be careful, as your opponent may have a secondary CQC weapon of their own.
  - The <Link href="/weapons/guns/aug">AUG</Link> and <Link href="/weapons/guns/arx160">ARX-160</Link> are good alternatives to SMGs against an AK-47, as they both offer higher DPS than the AK-47.
- The AK-47 may not be as effective at long range as some other assault rifles, DMRs, and snipers. Examples include the <Link href="/weapons/guns/mcx_spear">MCX Spear</Link> and <Link href="/weapons/guns/mini14">Mini-14</Link>.
- All SMGs have a shorter reload than the AK-47, so use this to your advantage.
