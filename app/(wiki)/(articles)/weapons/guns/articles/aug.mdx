The **Steyr AUG** is an Austrian bullpup assault rifle that first entered service in the Austrian army as the **StG 77**. It is known 
in-game as simple the **AUG**.

# Background
The AUG was designed by Steyr Arms in 1977 entering service in the same year. Since then, it has been a popular choice for militaries worldwide, 
first exporting to the US in 1980 and other countries later. It is still in service in many modern armies to this day.

# Strategies

## Using
- The AUG has a decently high spread when moving, so try not to run and gun too much
  - However, don't stand in one spot either as this makes you an easy target
- It has a higher DPS than the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47) making it an effective counter, especially in close quarters where spread matters less
- If you have a more accurate weapon such as a DMR or sniper, you can use the AUG in close range or to finish your opponent off

## Countering
- While you can rush with a high DPS close range weapon such as a [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) to counter an AUG user, be mindful that the AUG can
also be effective in close range
- Outranging your opponent is a viable tactic due to the high moving spread of the AUG
  - Snipers and DMRs can counter the AUG effectively
  - Be sure to pick up a larger scope (e.g., 4x or 8x) for this strategy to work

# Obtaining
The AUG is a very common gun, being more common than even the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47). Finding one from a crate or just on the floor should not be an
issue.
