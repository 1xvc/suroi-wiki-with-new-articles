The **Stoeger Industries M3K Freedom Series Defense Shotgun**, known in-game as the **M3K** is a semi-automatic shotgun utilizing 12-gauge ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.2.0 "Fun guns" update on May 28th, 2023. It has good range, decent damage, and a large magazine.

# Background
The M3K is an affordable budget semi-automatic shotgun offered by Stoeger Industries. Instead of a gas system to chamber the next round, it uses an inertia system developed by Benelli (Stoeger is a subsidiary of Benelli). This equates to fewer parts, meaning the M3K is very reliable and requires low maintenance. The family of shotguns is well known for the abundance of aftermarket parts and add-ons.
