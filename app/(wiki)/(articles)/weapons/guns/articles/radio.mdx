# Background
Radios are a type of communication device that utilizes electromagnetic radio waves between three hertz to 300 gigahertz. These waves are generated by a transmitter with an antenna, which radiates the radio waves. The first radio communication systems were developed in 1895 by Guglielmo Marconi and used morse code.
