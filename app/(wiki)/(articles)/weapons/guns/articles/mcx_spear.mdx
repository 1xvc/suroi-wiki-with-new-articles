The **SIG MCX-SPEAR** is a rifle developed by SIG Sauer, known in game as simply the **MCX Spear**. It is an installment in the SIG MCX series of carbines.
It was released to the civilian market in 2022.

# Background

The MCX Spear is a multi-caliber rifle commissioned by the US military in early 2019 as a potential M4 and M249 replacement. It was designated XM7 in
US military service, with a 10 year contract awarded to SIG Sauer for production of this gun. Since then it hasbeen released to the civilian market
in the United States as well.

# Strategies

## Using

- The MCX Spear has a higher DPS than comparable guns such as the [AK-47](/weapons/guns/ak47), [ARX-160](/weapons/guns/arx160) and [AUG](/weapons/guns/aug).
  Use this to your advantage when facing an opponent using one of these guns.
  - It is also more accurate which means a larger scope (4x or higher) will help you outrange your opponents
- However, the magazine capacity of the MCX Spear is on the lower side, being 20 instead of the standard 30 for similiar weapons. It is also hampered by a
  longer reload time.
  - Thus, it is important to reload often (behind cover of course) and to not miss your shots.
- While the MCX Spear can be used as a CQC weapon due to its higher DPS, it is still advisable to carry a secondary, high-DPS
  weapon such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) to deal with enemies at close range.

## Countering

- Rushing an MCX Spear user is more risky than other similar assualt rifles due to its higher DPS.
  - If you do decide to rush, make sure to have a high DPS weapon such as the [Micro Uzi](/weapons/guns/micro_uzi) or [Flues](/weapons/guns/flues)
- If you have a higher scope and a sniper or DMR you could try outrange them. Beware though, as the MCX Spear is still a powerful weapon at range.
- Generally, the MCX Spear is a potent weapon, especially in the hands of a skilled player
- Use cover, particulary indestructible cover when possible as being caught in the open against an MCX Spear user is a death sentence due to its high DPS
- Exploit the MCX Spear's low magazine capacity and long reload time by attacking when they are reloading
