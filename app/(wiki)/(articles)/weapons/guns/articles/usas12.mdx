The Daewoo Precision Industries USAS-12, known in-game as the USAS-12 is a powerful automatic shotgun firing explosive 12 Gauge ammunition. It was added into the game in v0.12.0 "Trick-or-Tweak" update on October 29th, 2023.

# Background
The USAS-12 was designed in 1989 by John Trevor Jr., and was based on previous automatic shotguns such as the AA-12. It was mass produced by Daewoo Precision Industries starting in the early 1990s. The shotgun saw very limited success in the civilian market due to heavy restrictions. However, it sold well for use in private security forces and special forces in South American and Asian countries.

# Strategies

The USAS-12 can be very powerful in mid-range combat due its high DPS and explosive rounds. However, it does not fare well in long-range combat as it is easily outranged by other weapons.

- Both the explosion and shrapnel have a high obstacle multiplier, allowing you to easily destroy cover such as trees or even rocks.
- Be careful not to accidentally damage yourself when using the USAS-12 at close range.
- The USAS-12 has a slow bullet speed so you will need to lead your shots when firing at moving targets.

# Obtaining
The USAS-12 has currently been obtainable in only two events.
- On the Halloween 2023 map, it had a 5% chance to drop from a pumpkin.
- The USAS-12 was also rarely acquired during the Suroi Weapon Swap Event upon killing another player with any gun.

# Trivia
- USAS-12 stands for "Universal Sporting Automatic Shotgun 12 gauge"
- In Suroi, the USAS-12 fires FRAG-12 ammunition
  - FRAG-12 is a specialized 12-gauge shell that contains a small amount of high explosive
