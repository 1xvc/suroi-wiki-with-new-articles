The **CZ 75 Automatic**, known in-game as the CZ-75A, it an automatic pistol utilizing 9mm ammunition. It was added to the game in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It shoots very fast, but has high spread and low damage.

# Background 
The CZ 75 was designed by František Koucký starting in 1969. It uses a recoil system similar to the Browning Hi-Power pistol, but unlike most pistols the slide rides inside its frame rails rather than outside. The CZ 75 Automatic variant was introduced in 1992 and has found use in military and law enforcement settings. It features a longer barrel with a compensator, and a spot to attach an extra magazine (which can also be used as a foregrip). The CZ 75 is used worldwide primarily by police.
