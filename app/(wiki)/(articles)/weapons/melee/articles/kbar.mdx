The K-Bar, also known as the KA-Bar, is a combat knife maunfctured by Camillus Cutlery Corperations and quickly adopted by the United States Marine Corperations in 1942. It was used mainly by the U.S. Marines during World War II but it still sees use today as a general purpose knife.

# Strategies
## Using
- Try to get up close to your opponent without losing too much health, then spam left click when you are close enough to your opponent.
  - Beware if they have a gun designed for close range combat, such as the [flues] (/weapons/guns/flues).
- Using any melee weapon requires good reaction time, as your opponent can escape your attack if they suddenly change directions.
## Countering
- If you see a player who has a K-Bar and is intrested in attacking you with it, stay at a distance and gun them down.
  - You can also attempt to rush in with a high DPS close-range weapon or another melee weapon, although this is risky if the K-Bar user is skilled.

# Obtaning
The K-Bar can be obtained rarely from crates or other common loot sources. It additionally has a three in four chance of spawning in the melee crate that appears once in a random position.
