The **Gas Can** is a melee weapon added in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 23, 2023.

# Background
The Gas Can is a type of storage container for fuels and is usually made out of plastic or metal. They come in many sizes and shapes.

# Strategies
## Using
- The Gas Can has almost identical stats to the fists, only having 2 extra damage and a larger swing range.
  - Thus it should be used as fists.
- The main purpose of the Gas Can is for use on the generator in the Port structure, which opens a vault that may contain a valuable gun when powered.
## Countering
- Due to its similarity with fists, the same countering strategies for it also apply to the Gas Can.

# Obtaining
The only way to obtain the Gas Can is to head to the ship in the Port structure and go inside the command center, which has the Gas Can at the center of the room.
