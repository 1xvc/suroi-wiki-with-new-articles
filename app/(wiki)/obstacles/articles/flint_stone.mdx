The **Flint Stone** is an indestructible [Obstacle](/obstacles) added to the game in the v0.10.0 "Back with a Bang" update on September 14th, 2023. It is only destroyable with an airdrop, but drops good loot.

# Location & Spawning

Only one Flint Stone spawns per map, and it can be anywhere on the map. - The Flint Stone is very difficult to see on the map due to its small size.

# Loot & More

The only way to break a Flint Stone is to get a [Radio](/weapons/guns/radio) and use the summoned airdrop to destroy the Flint Stone. - Technically, a naturally spawned airdrop can also break it, but this has never been observed in a game.
The Flint Stone has very good [loot](/loot#flint_stone), and drops either Tablets, a Medikit, or a [Gold Airdrop gun](/loot#gold_airdrop_guns). Each one of these has a 33.33% (1/3) chance of dropping.

# Tips

- The Flint Stone makes for very good cover due to its indestructible nature
- If you get a Radio, check the map to see if a Flint Stone is nearby that you can use it on
