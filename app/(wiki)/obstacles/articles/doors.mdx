**Doors** are a type of interactive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023.

# Location & Spawning
Doors spawn in between rooms of many structures such as the [Small House](/buildings/small_house). One Vault Door spawns each in the entrance to the Vault of the [Ship](/buildings/ship) in the [Port](/buildings/port) and the entrance to the vault in the [Armory](/buildings/armory). Garage Doors aren't interactive and must be broken to pass through. They only spawn in the Garage area of the [House](/buildings/house).

# Loot & More
"Wooden" Doors can be interacted with to change their position, which can allow players to enter another area without breaking the Door. Punching a "Wooden" Door using fists or a melee weapon causes it to open in the direction of the swing. Vault Doors can only be opened by solving a puzzle nearby. All Doors drop nothing upon being broken.

# Tips
- "Wooden" Doors are useful as cover as they can have their position manipulated to fit a player's needs or to annoy an opponent.
- Vault Doors can only be opened once by solving a puzzle, but they can be used as indestructible cover in specific situations.
- Garage Doors can be used as an alternative exit to the House.
