The **button** is an [obstacle](/obstacles) that only spawns inside of the armory vault. It was added to the game in v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on 1/14/24. These buttons can be pressed to enter a code to open the armory vault, which will give a weapon spawn of a vector, vepr-12, or a Arx-160.

# Location & Spawning

These only spawn in the Amory vault so far. Only 4 buttons spawn each game.
