The **Generator** is an interactive [Obstacle](/obstacles) added in the v0.11.0 "Making Waves" update on October 22nd, 2023.

# Location & Spawning
The Generator always spawns near the front of the [Ship](/buildings/ship) next to the vault.

# Loot & More
The Generator is indestructible and therefore drops no loot. When interacted with a [Gas Can](/weapons/melee/gas_can), it opens the vault, allowing access to the loot inside.

# Tips
- The Generator doesn't make effective cover due to its positioning.

# Trivia
- The Generator was designed by platonthek
- In real life, Generators are machines that convert potential, kinetic, or chemical energy into electricity. The Generator in suroi is a fuel-based generator since it requires Gas to operate
