The basic pack is the lowest tier of the packs (not including bag) and can fit a bit more ammo, healing items, & throwables. But still, not that much. 

# Obtaining

You can obtain the basic pack by opening basic, AEGIS, or flint crates. You can also find them in bushes and floors in the map. 

# Trivia 

 - The "basic pack" used to be called the "satchel"
 - The "satchel" was then changed into the "Lvl. 1 Pack" in <CommitLink sha="1da8f75e"/>
 - It was then later changed back to "basic pack"
