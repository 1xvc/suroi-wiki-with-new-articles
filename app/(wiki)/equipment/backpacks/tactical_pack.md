The tactical pack is the best pack in the game as of right now. It stores ultimately WAY TOO MUCH STUFF then what you would normally need. 

# Obtaining

The tactical pack can be obtained from crates (although it is more rare) but you're best chance is from an airdrop crate which has a 33.33% chance of spawning between the 3 tactical gear.

# Trivia 

 - The "tactical backpack" was changed to the "Lvl. 3 Pack" in <CommitLink sha="1da8f75e"/>
 - It was then later changed back to "tactical backpack"
