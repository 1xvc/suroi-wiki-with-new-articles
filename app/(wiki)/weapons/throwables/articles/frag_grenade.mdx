<Stub />
A grenade that explodes. It was added in game in the v0.15.0 (Unreleased) update. It can deal high damage, but has an extremely limited inventory capacity and can be risky to use as explosions can deal damage to the user

# Strategies

## Usage

Hold down the fire button to start cooking the grenade. To throw it, put your mouse cursor over to the target and release the fire button. All throwables go to where the mouse cursor is to a limited range

- Use the frag grenade as an attempt to damage enemies that are behind cover from a distance
- Don't cook the grenade for too long (see fuse time), as the grenade can explode in your hands

## Countering

- Move away from the grenade to avoid as much damage as possible
