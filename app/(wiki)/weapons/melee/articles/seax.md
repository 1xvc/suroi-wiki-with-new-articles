 - Compared to other melee the seax has the third slowest cooldown, but has a bit higher damage of 45.
 - Using a seax in combat is not recommended, but instead use it to break crates as it 2-shots them.

## Countering

 - Use a high-dps weapon like the [Model 37](/weapons/guns/model_37) to shoot down the seax user approaching you. 
 - Shoot at them from a distance and if they get too close run away until you have distance between you and them and shoot again until they die.

# Obtaining

The seax can only be obtained from a [viking chest](/obstacles/viking_chest) which are usually located along the shore in the map.
