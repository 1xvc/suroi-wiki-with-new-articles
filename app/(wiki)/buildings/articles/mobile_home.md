The **Mobile Home** is an obstacle added in v0.15.0 "Pulling the Pin" update on January 14, 2024. It is a small & compact structure with two lootable obstacles that mostly only give ammo. 

# Location & Spawning

The Mobile Home is a common structure that spawns throughout the whole map anywhere on land. Along with the Mobile Home, 2 [Boxes](/obstacles/box) will spawn behind the Mobile Home.

# Tips

 - If you have someone stuck inside of the Mobile Home you can throw a few [Frag Grenades](/weapons/throwables/frag_grenade) which will explode the stove and cause the whole structure and the person inside to get obliterated.
 - If you need a quick escape other than the two doors in the side and the back, you can break the [Window](/obstacles/mobile_home_window) to get a quick escape from an opponent.
