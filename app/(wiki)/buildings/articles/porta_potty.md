The **Porta Potty** is a small building added in the v0.9.0 "Behind Closed Doors" update on July 30th, 2023. It usually drops medical supplies, but guns can also be found as well. It can also be used as temporary cover against weaker weapons.

# Location & Spawning

The Porta Potty is the most common building on the map, and can be found all over the island. Up to 15 spawn randomly in the open, but more can spawn as part of the [Port](/buildings/port), [Refinery](/buildings/refinery), and [Armory](/buildings/armory).

# Loot & More

The Porta Potty spawns with either a closed toilet or an open one.

- The closed toilet drops medical supplies, and spawns 30% of the time.
- The open toilet typically drops guns, and spawns 70% of the time.

The Porta Potty also has a roll of toilet paper and a small sink with hand sanitizer on it. However, these are part of the walls and can't be looted.

# Tips

- Be careful against assault rifles, LMGs, and other weapons with high obstacle DPS. The Porta Potty can easily be shredded in seconds by those weapons.
- You can use the Porta Potty to absorb lots of damage and frustrate your opponent.
- The Porta Potty makes for a great spot to quickly disappear and heal up if needed.

# Trivia

- The Porta Potty was designed by 1092384, Slapdap, and Katloo
- The explanation for why an open Porta Potty toilet drops guns is that whoever put the guns in it either didn't have time to or couldn't shut the lid
