### How to Play

The goal of Suroi is to be the last player standing. You'll start with nothing, so move around the map to get weapons, scopes, armor, healing items, and ammo. If you see another player, eliminate them for their loot!

### Orange = Bad

You have another enemy to watch out for: a deadly orange gas. The gas slowly fills the map as the game progresses, making the safe zone smaller and smaller. The damage increases each time it shrinks.
